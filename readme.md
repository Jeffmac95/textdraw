#textdraw
I want to create a app for brainstorming/writing down new ideas.
 I want half the page to be a textarea where I can write details about the ideas/project then can save it to a .txt file. The other half of the screen would be a canvas that I can paint to then save it as a png.
 The .txt and .png would share the same name? and then be sent to a directory.
